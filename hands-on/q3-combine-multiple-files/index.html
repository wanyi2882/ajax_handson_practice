    <p>There are two files in `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`.</p>
    <p>Set up the `index.html` so that it can use axios.</p>
    <p>Then add in the code such that when the user clicks on the button, find a way to
        read in the content of both `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` and put their content
        inside the textbox, one after the other.</p>
    <p>There can only be one button. Both files should be loaded when the button is clicked.
        The content of both files should appear inside the textbox at the same time.</p>
